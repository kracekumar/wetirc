[17:41:29]: <Halts> whine is also bad.
[17:45:31]: <jamesprice> owned
[17:45:59]: <Halts> lol trillian is horrible for irc
[17:46:02]: <Halts> get a real irc client
[17:46:07]: <Halts> and trillian for everything else.
[17:46:16]: <jamesprice> i used mirc for a while but i just dont care anymore
[17:46:27]: <Halts> i use mirc with the nbs-irc addon
[17:46:31]: <Halts> which makes it awesome.
[17:46:37]: <jamesprice> whats that do
[17:46:39]: <Halts> mirc on its own is horrible.
[17:46:41]: <n2j3> lol
[17:46:55]: <Halts> it makes it's interface, and config stuff
[17:47:01]: <Halts> 1000000X easier to config
[17:47:16]: <jamesprice> oh
[17:47:20]: <jamesprice> maybe i will do that
[17:47:25]: <Halts> different little things, that just make it better.
[17:47:28]: <Halts> it's worth it.
[17:47:33]: <Halts> the only thing.
[17:47:33]: <jamesprice> i can imagine
[17:47:47]: <Halts> if you want it to look exactly like mirc
[17:47:55]: <Halts> just need to edit some colors and whatnot.
[17:48:03]: <Halts> notification colors
[17:48:07]: <Halts> easy peasy
[17:48:24]: <jamesprice> i want it to look exactly like words and shit
[17:48:42]: <patient> lol
[17:48:48]: <Halts> go to mirc classic theme
[17:48:52]: <Halts> colors on the top
[17:48:56]: <Halts> change them
[17:49:00]: <Halts> a tad.
[17:49:01]: <Halts> then
[17:49:30]: <Halts> display and fix the notification colors
[17:49:31]: <Halts> its real simple.
[17:49:49]: <Halts> the main reason i dont use linux much
[17:49:57]: <Halts> is because i like mirc roo much
[17:50:13]: <jamesprice> gosh
[17:50:41]: <Halts> I've used it since 2008
[17:51:00]: <Halts> I'm so accustomed to it. the nigger that made mirc should port it to linux
[17:51:42]: <jamesprice> just for you
[17:51:58]: <jamesprice> i assume there are clients that are very good for linux
[17:52:10]: <GLaTOPS-20> damn it
[17:52:21]: <Halts> its just not the same.
[17:52:24]: <GLaTOPS-20> !
